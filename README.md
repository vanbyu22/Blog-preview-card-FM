## My process

Just like the previous challenge (https://github.com/vanbyu22/QR-component-main) I layed out the design semantically, a "Main" container and a fixed/sticky "Footer" for the attribute.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 & CSS on VS Code

### What I learned

Continuing to write semantic and cleaner code, especially without having to refer back to previous projects. I've learned about the CSS Clamp(), which I had trouble working with as mentioned in the next section.

### Continued development

Continue to work on Responsive web design. The challege stated to try to find a way to resize the font without using media queries when resizing to mobile screens. I found out that the "clamp()" function does this but I haven't been able to figure out how to subtly shrinking the font without it getting really small. I've tried several different ways to use the clamp function but couldn't get it, so I reverted back to what I originally coded.

I got it to look almost identical to the preview image but the responsiveness is still lacking. Please feel free to give tips, critiques, and corrections. Always willing to learn.
